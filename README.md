# DCS autoKick script
Script to kick a player who is doing teamshooting or teamkilling.

<ins>How it works?</ins>
- Naughty player is shooting someone in his team
- The victim receives a message in the DCS chat
- The message tells to the victim (only) he has 30 seconds to kick the naughty player (if he wants).
- If the victim enters 'kick' in the DCS chat [2all], then the naughty player is ejected!
- The naughty player has a message telling him why he has being kick!
- A CSV file is saving the history of all the kicks!
- A temporary file is deleted at each mission start to avoid performance issue
